I have completed my MSc 2022 (focused in Computer Science) from Gulbarga University Gulbarga karnataka. For the last 2 years, I am exploring various fields of Data Science, and day by day I am getting even more and more curious about what all can be done using AI. I prefer implementing projects over the theory part as in my opinion that is the best way of learning. I have done various projects regarding Image Processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Classifications, Regressions, Clustering, and I am on a mission to contribute these projects to the community.
